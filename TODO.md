currently:
- fixing things I broke working on routing and layout
  - stale configs when switching presets (again)
  - reroll button is for all generators (again)
next:
- add a config editor
- timestamp cached configs and expire them with inactivity -- and/or replace w/same title?
- prevent re-randomizing to the same item
- pins for individual random items
- undo button for individual random items
